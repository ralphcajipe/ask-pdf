In total, the non-profit\\nhas raised less than $45M from Elon and more than $90M from other donors.\\nWhen starting OpenAI in late 2015, Greg and Sam had initially planned to raise $100M. Elon said in an\\nemail: “We need to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless… I think\\nwe should say that we are starting with a $1B funding commitment… I will cover whatever anyone\\nelse doesn't provide.” \\nWe spent a lot of time trying to envision a plausible path to AGI. In early 2017, we came to the\\nrealization that building AGI will require vast quantities of compute. We began calculating how much\\ncompute an AGI might plausibly require. We all understood we were going to need a lot more capital\\nto succeed at our mission—billions of dollars per year, which was far more than any of us, especially\\nElon, thought we’d be able to raise as the non-profit.[1]\\nWe and Elon recognized a for-profit entity would be necessary to acquire\\nthose resources\\nAs we discussed a for-profit structure in order to further the mission, Elon wanted us to merge with\\nTesla or he wanted full control. Elon left OpenAI, saying there needed to be a relevant competitor to\\nGoogle/DeepMind and that he was going to do it himself. He said he’d be supportive of us finding our\\nown path.\\nIn late 2017, we and Elon decided the next step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity. Elon\\nwanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO. In the middle of these discussions, he\\nwithheld funding. Reid Hoffman bridged the gap to cover salaries and operations.\\nWe couldn’t agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any\\nindividual to have absolute control over OpenAI. He then suggested instead merging OpenAI into\\nTesla. In early February 2018, Elon forwarded us an email suggesting that OpenAI should “attach to\\nTesla as its cash cow”, commenting that it was “exactly right… Tesla is the only path that could even\\nhope to hold a candle to Google. Even then, the probability of being a counterweight to Google is\\nsmall. It just isn’t zero”. \\nElon soon chose to leave OpenAI, saying that our probability of success was 0, and that he planned\\nto build an AGI competitor within Tesla. When he left in late February 2018, he told our team he was\\nsupportive of us finding our own path to raising billions of dollars.

Conversely,\\nalgorithmic advances alone are inert without the scale to also make them scary.\\nIt seems to me that OpenAI today is burning cash and that the funding model cannot reach the\\nscale to seriously compete with Google (an 800B company). If you can't seriously compete but\\ncontinue to do research in open, you might in fact be making things worse and helping them out\\n“for free”, because any advances are fairly easy for them to copy and immediately incorporate, at\\nscale.\\nA for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the\\ncurrent team, likely bring in a lot of investment.

       "['Based on the email conversation between Elon Musk and Greg Brockman, OpenAI faced several challenges:\\n\\n1. Financial constraints: OpenAI faced financial difficulties in competing with larger companies like Google, which had a much larger budget for AI research.\\n2. Lack of scalability: OpenAI\\'s compute horsepower was not sufficient to reach AGI, and it was unclear if the organization could \"catch up\" to Google scale.\\n3. Pressure from investors: OpenAI\\'s funding model was not sustainable, and investors might exert too much pressure in the wrong directions.\\n4. Competition from Elon Musk: Elon Musk started a competitor to OpenAI, which added an extra layer of competition for the organization.\\n5. Balancing open-source contributions with proprietary technology: OpenAI had to balance its mission of making AI beneficial tools widely available with the need to protect its proprietary technology.\\n6. Neutrality vs YC-centricity: OpenAI had to navigate the challenge of positioning itself as a neutral organization while also appealing to the general public and recruiting top talent.\\n7. Size of funding commitment: OpenAI had to go with a much bigger number than $100M to avoid sounding hopeless relative to what Google or Facebook are spending.']"
